 Project Update - 02/12/2025

Work Completed Last Week:
✅ Up to Step 7: Data Preprocessing, Encoding, and Initial Data Exploration.

Work Completed This Week:
✅ Step 8: Feature Selection – Choose features and target variable.  
✅ Step 9: Data Splitting – Split data into training and testing sets.  
✅ Step 10: Feature Scaling – Applied standardization using `StandardScaler()`.  
✅ Step 11: Model Training – Trained a `RandomForestRegressor` model.  
✅ Step 12: Model Evaluation – Calculated `MAE`, `MSE`, and `R² Score` for model performance.  

Next Steps:
- Improve model performance by tuning hyperparameters.
- Try different machine learning models for comparison.
